# Lab

All learning happens in the lab. In the past, I've made small proof of concept projects for my own education or curiousity that have been lost to time.

This repo will give those thoughts a home. Nothing in this repository could or would be wise to use for production code or your own projects. This lab exists for me, anything beyond that is at your own discretion.
